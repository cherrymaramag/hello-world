learning how to use repository

Hello, fellow users. I am Cherry, new at GitHub. I am in a learning mode and hopefuly learnings will stick! I am from the Bulacan, Philippines, a daughter, a wife, and a mother of 2. I look forward to work off to recharge doing gardening, cooking (and other housechores), and binge watching with my husband and/or kids. These keeps me sane as these trying times.
